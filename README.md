# WP-API-Endpoint
WordPress API Endpoint plugin with JSON Request &amp; Response

This plugin wrote based on my exprience working in CalibreWorks as web developer. I got task to create API endpoint to be connected with Android application for client.

After digging to google to find reference and code example, It turns out that creating an endpiont for an API in WordPress is super easy as follow:

- Create a custom rewrite as the API Enpoint URL
- Create a handler for the API request such as user authentication, query posts, update posts, etc.
- Send back JSON data response to client application.
